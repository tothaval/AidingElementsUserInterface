# AidingElementsUserInterface
experimental ui surface

UPDATE:
i finished my other projects and have now time to continue working on this project.
however, i am gonna rethink the concept first, make a new plan on the basic functionality,
gonna try implementing it using MVVM for some parts at least (gotta learn this first,
since i am a beginner), then i will continue working on content features like text,
drawing, organizinig of files and so on.


currently under development:
	many planned features are not yet implemented
	many implemented features may or may not work properly

use with caution
