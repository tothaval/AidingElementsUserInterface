development plan

further develop save and load of data and elements
finish level system
fix recently added bugs

start copying and transcribing texts and concepts to documentation document

find a solution for canvas backgrounds, because of canvas size
pictures are very large, it would probably be best if a smaller
viewport would display the background image and via image zoom
mechanic and optional a scrollviewer the user can traverse the canvas

once finished, work on unfinished stuff below this line
