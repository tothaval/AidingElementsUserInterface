development plan

update development plan with proper document

finish development of OptionsElement		
	later: harden the OptionElement against input errors

timer -> Clock, timer with setup	

integrate and transform these ysui predecessors for aeui

random element, corematrix classes
	continue development of random element
			integrate option for dice pictures

	finalize corematrix classes for intermediary use

bugs:
- selection rectangle is not working properly, selection is sometimes not inside the rectangle
- if an preconfigured aeui with data folder and set up configuration is opened from a link or
filelink element, also in ysui via bindingbutton, meaning it is executed via process.start(),
it will be opened unconfigured. no clue why, maybe the os stores a template or such, dunno.
really strange behaviour. same happens with different aeui.exe versions in different folders.
if opened via double click, it all loads fine from the same folder with the same .exe being executed.


update development plan
(f.e. start development on ColorOptions, start development of Container properties change tools
	continue integration of ysui functionality, refactor, comment, uml)
