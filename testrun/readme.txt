development started 3 days ago, it doesn't do much atm, and i haven't choosen a license yet,

testrun .exe may be executed under MIT license terms until a license is choosen for the entire project.

all files within this folder are needed to run the application, other licenses may apply to these other files, dunno.



currently implemented functions:

right click on surface: instantiate a right click element, which allows
	you to quit the application or shutdown your computer
	
F2: instantiate MyNote element, an application for the creation of notes
	to capture ideas, currently no save and load functionality implemented
